# Bestselling Nintendo Games by Console

This is a dataset that I scraped from Wikipedia articles about bestselling video games released on every major Nintendo console since the Nintendo Entertainment System.

I cleaned it up a little bit so that it would all be in the same format and such. Scraping.ipynb is a python notebook where I did all the actual scraping.

In order to avoid being rate-limited by Wikipedia, I had to perform all of the web requests seperately.
